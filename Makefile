# The documentation gate. Copied from docs-bootstrap's templates/Makefile to the root of the
# repository, next to .github/workflows/check.yaml copied from templates/workflow-check.yaml.
#
#   make check    the gate and the reports - exactly what CI runs
#   make fix      regenerate the backlog index, append missing coverage-map lines
#
# The CODE is not in here, deliberately. `./gradlew build` lives in .github/workflows/build.yaml
# together with the publication audits, and it takes minutes: a contributor editing a document
# should not need a JDK, and a documentation check should not queue behind a Kotlin/Native toolchain
# download. Two gates, each named, each run by CI by name.
#
# ONE VERSION OF THE CHECKS, WRITTEN DOWN ONCE: the `uses: youndie/docs-bootstrap@<ref>` line in
# .github/workflows/check.yaml. CI runs the checks at that ref because the runner resolves the line.
# This file reads the same line and fetches the same ref into .docs-bootstrap/, a directory that
# ignores itself, so `make check` here runs what CI runs - the same scripts, the same guard, the same
# flags. Renovate bumps the line, and the next `make check` fetches what CI already moved to.
#
# WHY THE SCRIPTS ARE NOT COPIED IN. A copied check runs, but at the version of the day it was copied,
# and a fix upstream never arrives: across one portfolio 18 copies of backlog_index.py were found in
# three versions, eleven of them without the guard that makes `--check` fail when the backlog has
# gone missing - a guard that existed upstream the whole time.
#
# WHY THE VERSION IS NOT ALSO WRITTEN HERE. A version pinned in the workflow and again in this file is
# two pins, and two pins drift: one is bumped, the other is found months later, and "green here, red
# there" comes back with nobody able to say which side is right. So this file holds none; if the
# workflow names two different refs, it refuses to choose.
#
# WHAT LIVES HERE is what is this repository's own: where the tree is, how the backlog is kept, and
# checks of its own under `gate`. How the documents are checked - including the guard that fails the
# gate when docs/ or the backlog is not there - is in check.mk at the pinned version, and changes
# arrive with a bump instead of with a re-copy.
#
# OVERRIDES. `DOCS_BOOTSTRAP=<dir>` runs the checks from a directory instead of the pinned ref: a
# clone of docs-bootstrap you are changing, or - offline, or without GitHub Actions - a committed
# copy of its check.mk, scripts/ and .claude-plugin/. That last one is the copy route again, with its
# drift; it is the fallback, not the default.

	# THE README'S MODULE TABLE AGAINST THE BUILD SCRIPTS. Here rather than in build.yaml because it
	# reads two files and needs no JDK — and here rather than nowhere because this exact row already
	# rotted once: `petich-chronik` said "jvm only" through the release that gave it a native
	# variant. A consumer reads the table before the build scripts, so a row that outlived its
	# module is the one thing in this repository that compiling cannot catch.
	$(PY) tools/module-table-audit.py
	# THE SAGA TABLE, DESCRIBED THREE WAYS. Here for the same reason as the row above: it reads
	# three files, needs no JDK, and the thing it guards is invisible to compiling. petich ships no
	# DDL, so what a consumer runs on an existing schema is a paragraph in the README — and a
	# paragraph beside a growing set of columns rots on the first release nobody edits it. 0.3.0
	# added three columns and named them nowhere; both consumers found out from a saga that failed.
